# Home Inventory App

This is a Ruby on Rails web application that allows users to create an account, log in, and make an inventory list of household items for insurance purposes. The application provides a user-friendly interface that enables users to add, edit or remove items from their inventory. Users can also add photos of their items to their inventory, which can help with the process of making an insurance claim. This application is not an open source project, which means that the source code is not publicly available for viewing or modification by other developers. However, the application is built using industry-standard coding practices and is regularly updated to ensure that it is secure and free of bugs.
